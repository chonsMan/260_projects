I think that the data structures performed the functionality very well. I was extremely impressed with the string class that I built and how well it interacted with the vector that I created. In fact, this is what I did because I had extra time and is how I chose to make the program better. It eliminates the need to delete certain portions of memory, thus making the program overall a more efficient one. I also included move semantics in this program, which instead of deeply copying the heap data it just copies the pointer and then set the original pointer to null. So the data that belonged to the original string is taken via an rvalue reference. The kicker is that there is no way that the client can detect that the source has been modified in any way whatsoever. It simply moves resources instead of copies, and this is highly efficient.
